Artemis financial is a consulting company who creates personalized financial plans for their customers.  The company is looking to modernize their operations, and in doing so, including the most up-to-date and effctive security protocols.  They are seeking expertise on how to protect the company from external threats while using their RESTful web API.

I believe that I had emplimented the hash function very well.  Coding securly is important for an abundance of reasons, especially when dealing with customers personal information, in which Artemis Financial's operation is based around.  Every company who uses the internet should be aware their entire wellbeing is based around their software security.  In the absense of proper software security, their entire operation can be compromised, possible leading the fall of the company.

The most help provided by the vulnerability assessment was to know if the tools you are utilizing are up to date.  When receiving a vulnerability on certain tools, unless false positives, it will indicate that the tool you are using may be out of date.

I believe using the maven tool to assess vulnerabilities will be something I use moving forward.  While it can sometimes be hard to interpret, it is the most helpful tool to understand the issues with the program and how to mitigate them.

A quick check before and after refactoring the code is an issue way to tell if any new vulnerabilities were introduced into the application.

Again, the vulnerability check was the most helpful tool, and a tool that I will use in the future when creating security measures for applications.

I believe something that I would show a future employer from this assignment would be hash function and refactored code.  It would also be good to show the process of finding false positives and the process of suppressing them.
